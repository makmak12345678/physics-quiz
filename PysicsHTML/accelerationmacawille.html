            <span class="white-text">Acceleration (ak SEL uhr AY shuhn) is the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity changes if speed changes, if direction changes, or if both change. So, an object accelerates if its speed, its direction, or both change.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">What is the direction of acceleration? <br/></span>
            <span class="white-text">When speeding up, acceleration is in the same direction that the object is moving; when slowing down, acceleration is opposite to the direction that the object is moving.<br/><br/>What if the direction acceleration is at an angle to the direction of motion. The direction of motion will turn toward the direction of acceleration (making an arc)<br/><br/>An increase in velocity is commonly called positive acceleration. (Because subtracting the initial speed from the final speed gives a positive number) A decrease in velocity is commonly called negative acceleration, or deceleration. (because subtracting the initial speed from the final speed gives a negative number) Keep in mind that acceleration is not only how much velocity changes but also how fast velocity changes. The faster it changes, the greater the acceleration.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Calculating Average Acceleration <br/></span>
            <span class="white-text">You can find average acceleration by using the equation: Velocity is expressed in meters per second (m/s), and time is expressed in seconds (s). So acceleration is expressed in meters per second per second, or (m/s)/s, which equals m/s2.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Calculating Acceleration <br/></span>
            <span class="white-text">Calculate the acceleration of a bus whose speed changes from 6 m/s to 12 m/s over a period of 3 s. Step 1 What do you initial  speed: si = 6 m/s know? final speed: sf = 12 m/s time: t = 3 s Step 2 What do you acceleration: want to find? a = (sf – si ) / t Step 3 Substitute a = (12 m/s – 6 m/s) 3 s a = 2 m/s2</span>

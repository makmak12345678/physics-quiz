            <span class="text">Speed is a type of rate. Rate is the amount of something that occurs or changes in one unit of time. If you know the distance an object travels in a certain amount of time, you can calculate the speed of the object. The speed of an object is the distance the object travels per unit of time. Most of the time we measure average speed, not instantaneous speed. Speed commonly recorded in Kilometers per hour.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="formula-title">Formula<br/></span>
            <span class="text">Speed = distance time in meters in seconds s (m/s) = d (m) / t (s) s = d / t<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="formula-title">Calculating Speed.<br/></span>
            <span class="text">How is speed calculated? Speed = Distance/ Time (s = d/t) To calculate the speed you divide the distance traveled by the time it takes to travel that distance. Distance = speed x time Used to measure how fast plates are moving. UNITS: Measured in m/s.<br/><br/>
                » Constant Speed- speed does not change over time. Most objects do not move at constant speeds.<br/>
                » Average Speed- speed of motion when speed is changing. To find it divide total distance by total time. Avg Speed = Total Distance/ Total Time Total distance = 32km + 13km = 45km Total time = 2hr + 1hr = 3hr Average speed = 45km/3hr = 15km per hour » Instantaneous Speed- rate at which an object is moving at any given instant in time (speedometer)<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="formula-title">Example<br/></span>
            <span class="text">Calculate the speed of a swimmer who swims 100 m in 56 s.<br/>
                Step 1 What do you know? distance: d = 100m, time: t = 56 s<br/>
                Step 2 What do you want to find? speed: s = d / t<br/>
                Step 3 Substitute s = 100 m / 56 s, s = 1.8 m/s<br/><br/>

            <span class="text">another. The blue line in the graph in below shows the total distance traveled during a 4 h period. Notice that the distance traveled during each hour is different. The distance varies because the speed is not constant. The driver may change speed because of weather, traffic, or varying speed limits. The average speed for the entire trip can be calculated as follows: The red line on the graph shows how far the driver must travel each hour to reach the same city if he or she moved at a constant speed. The slope of this line is the average speed.</span>

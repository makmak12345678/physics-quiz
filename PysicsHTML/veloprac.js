        question: "Two runners traveling along the same straight path start and end their run at the same time. At the halfway mark, they have different instantaneous velocities. Is it possible for their average velocities for the entire trip to be the same ?",
        answer : "Yes, because average velocity depends on the net or total displacement.",

                        "No, because the velocities of both runners must remain exactly the same throughout the journey.",
                        "No, because the instantaneous velocities of the runners must remain the same at the midpoint but can vary at other points."

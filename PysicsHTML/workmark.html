            <span class="blue-text">Fig. 1.1. Work is done when a constant force F acts in the same direction as the displacement, d. <br/></span>
            <span class="white-text">Work done, W, on a body by a constant force, F, acting on the body is defined as the product of the magnitude of the force and the distance through which the object moves, or in equation, W = Fd <br/><br/>From the equation, work done on the body is greater if F is greater, or if d is greater, or if both F and d are greater. What is the SI unit of work? Yes, you are right! The SI unit for work is <br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Unit of work = unit of F x unit of d = newton x meter (N-m) <br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">The unit N-m is given a special name, Joule, in honor of James Prescott Joule. Therefore </span>
            <span class="blue-text">1 joule (J) = 1 newton-meter (N-m)<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">What is the unit of work if F is in dynes and d is in cm? That’s right! The unit of work is dyne-cm, which is given a special name of erg. So, </span>
            <span class="blue-text">1 erg = 1 dyne-cm<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="white-text">Now consider the situation that follows. A bag is pulled as shown in Fig. 1.2. Is work done on the bag? <br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Fig. 1.2 A bag pulled a distance, d <br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">A force F acts along the handle of the bag and makes an angle θ with the surface of the table. A component of this force, Fcosθ, moves the bag along the surface of the table. The work done on the bag is the product of this component of the force and the magnitude of the displacement, d, along which the bag moves.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">W = Fcos θ d <br/><br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">where θ is the angle (180º or less) between the direction of F and the direction of d. The F and d are the magnitudes of the force and displacement vectors, respectively. They are both scalar quantities. Also, we assume that the force and θ are constant while the object is having a displacement. Now, going back to the first two examples, wherein the book is lifted and the table is pushed, could the equation <br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">W= F cos θ d<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">be used? Let’s analyze. When the bag is lifted, the direction of the force and the displacement is the same. Therefore, θ is 0, and cos θ = 1. The equation<br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">W= F cos θ d <br/><br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">becomes<br/></span>

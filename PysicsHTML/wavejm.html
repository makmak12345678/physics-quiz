            <span class="blue-text">Mechanical Waves:<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">Transverse Waves: In a transverse wave, the particles of the medium move perpendicular to the direction of the wave. Examples include water waves and electromagnetic waves.<br/>
            Longitudinal Waves: In a longitudinal wave, the particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of the wave. Sound waves are an example of longitudinal waves.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Electromagnetic Waves:<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium for propagation and can travel through a vacuum. They include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Wave Characteristics:<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">Amplitude: The maximum displacement from equilibrium.<br/>
            Frequency: The number of oscillations per unit time (measured in Hertz, Hz).<br/>
            Wavelength: The distance between two successive points in a wave.<br/>
            Speed: The rate at which a wave travels, often given by the product of frequency and wavelength (speed = frequency × wavelength). <br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Wave Equations:<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">The speed of a wave (v) is related to its frequency (f) and wavelength (λ) by the equation: v=f×λ.<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">Wave Interference:<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">Waves can interfere constructively (amplitudes add up) or destructively (amplitudes cancel out) when they overlap.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Standing Waves:<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">Formed by the interference of incident and reflected waves. Nodes are points of minimum displacement, while antinodes are points of maximum displacement.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Doppler Effect:<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">The change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. It explains why a siren sounds different as it approaches and then passes by.<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">Superposition Principle:<br/></span>
            <span class="gray-text">States that when two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement at any point is the algebraic sum of the displacements of the individual waves.</span>

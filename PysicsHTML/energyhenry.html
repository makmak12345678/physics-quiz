            <span class="gray-text">1. Get a plastic ruler that could be bent without breaking.<br/>2. Hold it on the table, then, bend it. Place a piece of chalk near the bent end of the ruler. <br/>3. Release the bent end of the ruler. Describe what happened to the chalk. <br/></span>
            <span class="white-text"><br/>Work was done when you bent the ruler. Energy is transferred from you to the ruler. Because of its bent position, the ruler possesses energy. This energy due to its bent position is </span>
            <span class="blue-text">elastic potential energy.</span>
            <span class="white-text"> If you place an object beside the bent end of the ruler, and then, release the bent end of the ruler, the object would be hit and pushed to a distance. A slingshot with its rubber stretched also has elastic potential energy. If a stone is placed in between the stretched rubber, the slingshot can do work by releasing the rubber from your hold.</span>

            <span class="gray-text">One of the most familiar forms of potential energy is gravitational potential energy. In the previous section of this lesson, you learned about potential energy. You also learned about what gravitational potential energy is. In this section, you will learn how to determine gravitational potential energy. Consider again an object of mass, m, lifted to a certain height, h. Work done on the object gives this object gravitational potential energy. The change in Key to answers on page 41 14 the object’s gravitational potential energy is the work done in raising it to that height. Since the work done on the object to raise it at that height is given by the equation,</span>
            <span class="blue-text"> <br/><br/>W = mgh <br/><br/></span>
            <span class="white-text">then, the change in the object’s gravitational potential energy is<br/><br/></span>
            <span class="blue-text">∆PE = mgh <br/><br/></span>
            <span class="white-text">where h = the height above the reference level. If the object is raised from the ground, the reference level is the ground. If the object, however, is raised from the table, the table is the reference level. Using the equation we have derived, could you give the unit of gravitational potential energy? Yes, you are right! The unit of gravitational energy is the same as the unit of work, joule. To understand more about gravitational potential energy, let us use the equation in solving problems. Study very well the following sample problems.</span>
